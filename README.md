# Mean-Fluorescence-Intensity
### Introduction
Our project involves the validation of antibody-cell connections in cell experiments by observing confocal fluorescence intensity.  Considering that confocal analysis is a widely used technique in current research, and standardization of confocal data image processing often involves repetitive selection steps to calculate average fluorescence intensity.  Consequently, we have developed a software specifically designed for high-throughput analysis of confocal image fluorescence intensity, inspired by the tedious data processing involved in wet lab experiments. This script provides the high throughput processing of tif images using macro language in Fiji.

With our program, we can directly perform automatic normalization and statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity for all images in a given folder, significantly reducing repetitive workload and streamlining the process.

Although our starting point was quantitative analysis of antibodies bound to the cell, actually, the analysis of fluorescence intensity can also be used to quantify protein expression levels, examine changes in cellular processes, and compare signal intensities between different samples or experimental conditions.
This is one of the softwares made by westlake-china team in iGEM competitoin. The script provides high throughput processing of tif images using macro language in Fiji.

### Startup
1. Download Fiji via https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads.
2. Open Process_Folder.ijm in Fiji app and click "run" button at the bottom of the window.
3. Choose the input directory containing the images and theh output directory for resulted data, which is an excel file.
